Hello! My name is Priyanka Sanjay Rane and I am a MS MIS student at UIC have a background in Computer Engineering from Dwarkadas J Sanghvi College of Engineering, Mumbai. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Management Information Systems at UIC and working as a Graduate Assistant at UIC College of Dentistry, Office of Academic Affairs.

Before my current position, I gained extensive experience in the field of application development and project management. I worked as a Team Lead at Belgian Rails, where I led a team of 5 developers to develop and deliver four mobile applications. I collaborated with Business Analysts, Customers, and Delivery Managers to identify market segments for upcoming projects and established the infrastructure for project development.

During my time at Belgian Rails, I also served as a Senior Automations Application Developer and Application Developer. Prior to this, I worked as an Application Support Executive at Tata Consultancy Services and a Developer at JP Morgan.

Overall, my experience in application development and project management has helped me become an effective problem-solver and team leader. I am excited to continue growing and developing in the field of Management Information Systems.
